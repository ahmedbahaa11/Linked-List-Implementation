#  Linked List Implementation

This File.c Contain implementation of all Functions of Linked List that use to Build Data Structure . 


### The Functions:

- initilization -> (List_voidInitList).
- Insert Data at specific position in list -> (List_voidInsertList).
- Insert Data at last Position directly -> (List_voidInsertLast).
- Replace Data at specific position in list -> (List_voidReplaceList).
- Read Data from specific position in list -> (List_voidRetriveList).
- Delete Data from specific position in list and free it from Memory -> (List_voidDeleteList).
- Print all Data from all list nodes -> (List_voidPrintList).
- Destroy Data from all list nodes and free all list from Memory -> (List_voidDestroyList).
- Traverse all Data from all list nodes -> (List_voidTraverseList).
- check the list is Empty or Not -> (List_u16isEmpty).
- check the list is Full or Not -> (List_u16isFull).
- Return Size of list Elements -> (List_u16SizeList).



## Code Language

- By C Language.


## Features 

- This Code contain main function To Check All Functions of Linked List are working is correct.
